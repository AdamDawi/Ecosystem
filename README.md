# Ecosystem
This is an ecosystem project. The project is the result of my university classes.

### About ecosystem:
The virtual ecosystem is a simple biocybernetic simulator of ecosystem development, created by three species of virtual organisms: algae - marked as *, fungi #, and bacteria @. The ecosystem environment is a rectangular grid consisting of cells. Each cell can be either empty, occupied by a living organism, or occupied by a dead organism. The development of the ecosystem occurs in consecutive simulation steps.
